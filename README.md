# Travel

Travel was created for those who want to take traveling in their own hand. With a easy to use map which can work on all devices. Travel is the
perfect app for you who don't have time to waste. The app allows you to search in every area the best and most popular hotels,
museums, restaurants, bars and if you want take it to the next level, night clubs.

## UX
My goal in the design is to make it as easy as possible to search the location you need while containing a clan and minimalistic design.
The greyscale color scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel.
